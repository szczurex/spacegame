Simple Game About Scavenge and survival

IMPLEMENTED:
- Randomized levels, ships, starting resources
- Moving around and scavenging resources
- Proper death
- Fog of war
- ASCII graphics (with simple colors)

TODO:
- Improve the Fog of War (raise the unfolding to 3x3 field instead of 1x1, game is too hard right now)
- Marking of empty/scavenged vessels

Future Ideas:
- Graphics (any will do...)
- Stamina system - Give some more meaning to the battery/air consumption, add a "camp" option.
- Random encounters
- Escape Pod
- Collecting Escape Pod parts
- Inventory system
- Items
